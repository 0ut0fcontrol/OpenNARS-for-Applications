**Minimal Sensorimotor Component**

A minimal component supporting:
- Learning from event streams in real time
- Pursuing of multiple goals in parallel

Theory: ANSNA / NARS, especially NAL7/8
It will be realized by starting with ANSNA v0.6.0, removing SDR's and replacing them with atomic terms (and sequences thereof) for events.
